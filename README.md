## Here's the project <a href="https://undisclosed64.github.io/library-project/">live <a/>.
 
## Description:
This is a library project using vanilla JS,HTML and CSS. The primary focus of this project was using local storage. This project lets us keep track of books we have read or we plan to read. It uses a form to take data where we specify the name and author of the book,number of pages it has,and whether we have read it or not. It then stores the information in our browser and display it as a card, each card representing a book. This project taught me how to work with local storage effectively.
